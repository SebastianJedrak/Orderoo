It is possible to add both products and packages for individual years.

Orderoo allows you to change the view between user and admin. User view allows you to place an order from the available offer for a given year and view available packages. The admin panel allows you to edit both products and packages.

In the user section you can order products. The price of the order will dynamically change after selecting the product. Any promotions resulting from combining products into a package will be taken into account automatically. 


#### List of Packages
